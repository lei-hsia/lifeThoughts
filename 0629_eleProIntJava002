Algorithm patterns:

1. Analysis principle: 
    
    1. Concrete examples: Manually solve concrete instances of problems and build a general solution
    2. Case analysis: split input/execution into a number of cases and solve each case in isolation
    3. Iterative refinement: Most problems can be solved by brute-force. 
                          Find such a solution and improve
    4. Reduction: use a well-known solutin to some other problem as a subroutine
    5. Graph modeling
    
  
2. Technique: 
    
    1. Sorting
    2. Recursion
    3. Divide and conquer
    4. DP
    5. Greedy
