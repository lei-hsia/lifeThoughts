1. sudo systemctl daemon-reload: 
    man systemctl says: "
        daemon-reload: would reload systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all generators, 
    reload all unit files, and recreate the entire dependency tree. While daemon is being reloaded, all sockets
    systemd listens on behalf of user configuration will stay accessible."
  >>
   It's a soft reload: take changed configurations from filesystem and regenerate dependency trees.

    Consequently, systemd.generator states: 
        "Generators are small binaries that live in /usr/lib/systemd/user-generators/ and other directories listed 
         above. systemd(1) will execute those binaries very early at bootup and at configuration reload time ---
         before unit files are loaded. Generators can dynamically generate unit files or crate symbolic links to unit 
         files to add additional denpendencies, thus extending or overriding existing definitions.
