In the summer of 2019, I did an internship at the Software Dev. team in Greenwich, CT office of Interative Brokers(IB) LLC. 

This internship included training by top engineers about the inner workings of IB as a company, how to use their tools for the daily developer workflow, a primitive web service project as well as a real-world project. The real-world project concerned the project Consolidated Audit Trail(CAT), which track orders throughout their life cycle and identify the broker-dealers handling them, thus allowing regulators to more efficiently track activity in Eligible Securities throughout US markets.

In addition to daily work that focus more on the tech size of fintech, we also have regular "Snack && Learn" sessions each Friday afternoon, topics of which range a lot from the history of IB to all sorts of issues and insights in financial markets.
