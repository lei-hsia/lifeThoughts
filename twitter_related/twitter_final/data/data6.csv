@dangerbritney That's what I hoped for! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@BuzzFeed Chillin' with you ;)
@WesleyWalrus Well thank you. Don't cry though! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
He suggested getting Foster The People 2 help on production. I really think they nailed it. They added a few bells &amp; the whistle on the song
When @iamwill &amp; I were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. It felt like it needed something to make the song more unique...
Funny story about that! RT @EmreAkn I love the whistle in the beginning. It gives me chills. And the lyrics are soo emotional :(
"@neevebayb Means the world sweetie, thank you! #BritneyJeanListeningParty"
This one was very therapeutic for me. Sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on.
Really proud of the final version of #DontCry :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@GrantPYoung @jamielynnspears I have too! It finally felt right for this album. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
