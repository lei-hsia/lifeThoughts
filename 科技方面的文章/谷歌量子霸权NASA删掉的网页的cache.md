Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor
Google AI Quantum and collaboratorsy
The tantalizing promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be
executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor. A fundamen-
tal challenge is to build a high-delity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an
exponentially large computational space. Here, we report using a processor with programmable
superconducting qubits to create quantum states on 53 qubits, occupying a state space 253 Ë˜1016.
Measurements from repeated experiments sample the corresponding probability distribution, which
we verify using classical simulations. While our processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one
instance of the quantum circuit 1 million times, a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require
approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task. This dramatic speedup relative to all
known classical algorithms provides an experimental realization of quantum supremacy on a com-
putational task and heralds the advent of a much-anticipated computing paradigm.
In the early 1980s, Richard Feynman proposed that a
quantum computer would be an eective tool to solve
problems in physics and chemistry, as it is exponentially
costly to simulate large quantum systems with classical
computers [1]. Realizing Feynmanâ€™s vision poses signi-
cant experimental and theoretical challenges. First, can
a quantum system be engineered to perform a computa-
tion in a large enough computational (Hilbert) space and
with low enough errors to provide a quantum speedup?
Second, can we formulate a problem that is hard for a
classical computer but easy for a quantum computer? By
computing a novel benchmark task on our superconduct-
ing qubit processor[2{7], we tackle both questions. Our
experiment marks a milestone towards full scale quantum
computing: quantum supremacy[8].
In reaching this milestone, we show that quantum
speedup is achievable in a real-world system and is
not precluded by any hidden physical laws. Quantum
supremacy also heralds the era of Noisy Intermediate-
Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies. The benchmark
task we demonstrate has an immediate application in
generating certiable random numbers[9]; other initial
uses for this new computational capability may include
optimization optimization [10{12], machine learning[13{
15], materials science and chemistry [16{18]. However,
realizing the full promise of quantum computing (e.g.
Shorâ€™s algorithm for factoring) still requires technical
leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits[19{23].
To achieve quantum supremacy, we made a number of
technical advances which also pave the way towards er-
ror correction. We developed fast, high-delity gates that
can be executed simultaneously across a two-dimensional
qubit array. We calibrated and benchmarked the pro-
cessor at both the component and system level using a
powerful new tool: cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).
Finally, we used component-level delities to accurately
predict the performance of the whole system, further
showing that quantum information behaves as expected
when scaling to large systems.
A COMPUTATIONAL TASK TO
DEMONSTRATE QUANTUM SUPREMACY
To demonstrate quantum supremacy, we compare our
quantum processor against state-of-the-art classical com-
puters in the task of sampling the output of a pseudo-
random quantum circuit[24{26]. Random circuits are a
suitable choice for benchmarking since they do not pos-
sess structure and therefore allow for limited guarantees
of computational hardness[24, 25, 27, 28]. We design the
circuits to entangle a set of quantum bits (qubits) by re-
peated application of single-qubit and two-qubit logical
operations. Sampling the quantum circuitâ€™s output pro-
duces a set of bitstrings, e.g. f0000101, 1011100, ...g.
Due to quantum interference, the probability distribution
of the bitstrings resembles a speckled intensity pattern
produced by light interference in laser scatter, such that
some bitstrings are much more likely to occur than oth-
ers. Classically computing this probability distribution
becomes exponentially more dicult as the number of
qubits (width) and number of gate cycles (depth) grows.
We verify that the quantum processor is working prop-
erly using a method called cross-entropy benchmarking
(XEB) [24, 26], which compares how often each bitstring
is observed experimentally with its corresponding ideal
probability computed via simulation on a classical com-
puter. For a given circuit, we collect the measured bit-
strings fx
igand compute the linear XEB delity [24{
26, 29], which is the mean of the simulated probabilities
of the bitstrings we measured:
F
XEB = 2
nhP(x
i)i
i 1 (1)
where nis the number of qubits, P(x
i) is the probability
of bitstring x
i computed for the ideal quantum circuit,
and the average is over the observed bitstrings. Intu-
itively, F
XEB is correlated with how often we sample high
probability bitstrings. When there are no errors in the
quantum circuit, sampling the probability distribution
will produce F
XEB = 1. On the other hand, sampling
from the uniform distribution will give hP(x
i)i
i = 1=2n
and produce F
XEB = 0. Values of F

1 correspond to the probability that no error has oc-
curred while running the circuit. The probabilities P(x
i)
must be obtained from classically simulating the quan-
tum circuit, and thus computing F
XEB is intractable in
the regime of quantum supremacy. However, with certain
circuit simplications, we can obtain quantitative delity
estimates of a fully operating processor running wide and
deep quantum circuits.
Our goal is to achieve a high enough F
XEB for a circuit
with sucient width and depth such that the classical
computing cost is prohibitively large. This is a dicult
task because our logic gates are imperfect and the quan-
tum states we intend to create are sensitive to errors. A
single bit or phase
ip over the course of the algorithm
will completely shue the speckle pattern and result in
close to 0 delity [24, 29]. Therefore, in order to claim
quantum supremacy we need a quantum processor that
executes the program with suciently low error rates.
BUILDING AND CHARACTERIZING A
HIGH-FIDELITY PROCESSOR
We designed a quantum processor named \Sycamore"
which consists of a two-dimensional array of 54 trans-
mon qubits, where each qubit is tunably coupled to four
nearest-neighbors, in a rectangular lattice. The connec-
tivity was chosen to be forward compatible with error-
correction using the surface code [20]. A key systems-
engineering advance of this device is achieving high-
delity single- and two-qubit operations, not just in iso-
lation but also while performing a realistic computation
with simultaneous gate operations on many qubits. We
discuss the highlights below; extended details can be
found in the supplementary information.
In a superconducting circuit, conduction electrons con-
dense into a macroscopic quantum state, such that cur-
rents and voltages behave quantum mechanically [2, 30].
Our processor uses transmon qubits [6], which can be
thought of as nonlinear superconducting resonators at 5
to 7 GHz. The qubit is encoded as the two lowest quan-
tum eigenstates of the resonant circuit. Each transmon
has two controls: a microwave drive to excite the qubit,
and a magnetic
ux control to tune the frequency. Each
qubit is connected to a linear resonator used to read out
the qubit state [5]. As shown in Fig. 1, each qubit is
also connected to its neighboring qubits using a new ad-
justable coupler [31, 32]. Our coupler design allows us to
quickly tune the qubit-qubit coupling from completely
o to 40 MHz. Since one qubit did not function properly
the device uses 53 qubits and 86 couplers.
The processor is fabricated using aluminum for metal-
ization and Josephson junctions, and indium for bump-
bonds between two silicon wafers. The chip is wire-
bonded to a superconducting circuit board and cooled
to below 20 mK in a dilution refrigerator to reduce am-
bient thermal energy to well below the qubit energy.
The processor is connected through lters and attenu-
ators to room-temperature electronics, which synthesize
the control signals. The state of all qubits can be read
simultaneously by using a frequency-multiplexing tech-
nique[33, 34]. We use two stages of cryogenic ampliers
to boost the signal, which is digitized (8 bits at 1 GS/s)
and demultiplexed digitally at room temperature. In to-
tal, we orchestrate 277 digital-to-analog converters (14
bits at 1 GS/s) for complete control of the quantum pro-
cessor.
We execute single-qubit gates by driving 25 ns mi-
crowave pulses resonant with the qubit frequency while
the qubit-qubit coupling is turned o. The pulses
are shaped to minimize transitions to higher transmon
states[35]. Gate performance varies strongly with fre-
quency due to two-level-system (TLS) defects[36, 37],
stray microwave modes, coupling to control lines and
the readout resonator, residual stray coupling between
qubits,
ux noise, and pulse distortions. We therefore

optimize the single-qubit operation frequencies to miti-
gate these error mechanisms.
We benchmark single-qubit gate performance by using
the XEB protocol described above, reduced to the single-
qubit level (n= 1), to measure the probability of an error
occurring during a single-qubit gate. On each qubit, we
apply a variable number mof randomly selected gates
and measure F
XEB averaged over many sequences; as m
increases, errors accumulate and average F
XEB decays.
We model this decay by [1 e
1=(1 1=D2)]m where e
1 is
the Pauli error probability. The state (Hilbert) space di-
mension term, D= 2n = 2, corrects for the depolarizing
model where states with errors partially overlap with the
ideal state. This procedure is similar to the more typical
technique of randomized benchmarking [21, 38, 39], but
supports non-Cliord gatesets [40] and can separate out
decoherence error from coherent control error. We then
repeat the experiment with all qubits executing single-
qubit gates simultaneously (Fig.2), which shows only a
small increase in the error probabilities, demonstrating
that our device has low microwave crosstalk.
We perform two-qubit iSWAP-like entangling gates by
bringing neighboring qubits on resonance and turning on
a 20 MHz coupling for 12 ns, which allows the qubits to
swap excitations. During this time, the qubits also ex-
perience a controlled-phase (CZ) interaction, which orig-
inates from the higher levels of the transmon. The two-
qubit gate frequency trajectories of each pair of qubits are
optimized to mitigate the same error mechanisms consid-
ered in optimizing single-qubit operation frequencies.
To characterize and benchmark the two-qubit gates,
we run two-qubit circuits with mcycles, where each cy-
cle contains a randomly chosen single-qubit gate on each
of the two qubits followed by a xed two-qubit gate. We
learn the parameters of the two-qubit unitary (e.g. the
amount of iSWAP and CZ interaction) by using F
XEB
as a cost function. After this optimization, we extract
the per-cycle error e
2c from the decay of F
XEB with m,
and isolate the two-qubit error e
2 by subtracting the two
single-qubit errors e
1. We nd an average e
2 of 0:36%.
Additionally, we repeat the same procedure while simul-
taneously running two-qubit circuits for the entire array.
After updating the unitary parameters to account for ef-
fects such as dispersive shifts and crosstalk, we nd an
average e
2 of 0.62%.
For the full experiment, we generate quantum circuits
using the two-qubit unitaries measured for each pair dur-
ing simultaneous operation, rather than a standard gate
for all pairs. The typical two-qubit gate is a full iSWAP
with 1=6 of a full CZ. In principle, our architecture could
generate unitaries with arbitrary iSWAP and CZ inter-
actions, but reliably generating a target unitary remains
an active area of research.
Finally, we benchmark qubit readout using standard
dispersive measurement [41]. Measurement errors aver-
aged over the 0 and 1 states are shown in Fig 2a. We have
also measured the error when operating all qubits simul-
taneously, by randomly preparing each qubit in the 0 or
1 state and then measuring all qubits for the probability
of the correct result. We nd that simultaneous readout
incurs only a modest increase in per-qubit measurement
errors.
Having found the error rates of the individual gates and
readout, we can model the delity of a quantum circuit
as the product of the probabilities of error-free opera-

tion of all gates and measurements. Our largest random
quantum circuits have 53 qubits, 1113 single-qubit gates,
430 two-qubit gates, and a measurement on each qubit,
for which we predict a total delity of 0:2%. This delity

s is the

larger and larger systems does not introduce additional
error sources beyond the errors we measure at the single-
and two-qubit level | in the next section we will see how
well this hypothesis holds.
FIDELITY ESTIMATION IN THE SUPREMACY
REGIME

circuit generation is shown in Fig.3. One cycle of the
algorithm consists of applying single-qubit gates chosen
randomly from f
p
X;
p
Y;
p
Wgon all qubits, followed
by two-qubit gates on pairs of qubits. The sequences of
gates which form the \supremacy circuits" are designed
to minimize the circuit depth required to create a highly
entangled state, which ensures computational complexity
and classical hardness.
While we cannot compute F
XEB in the supremacy
regime, we can estimate it using three variations to re-
duce the complexity of the circuits. In \patch circuits",
we remove a slice of two-qubit gates (a small fraction
of the total number of two-qubit gates), splitting the cir-
cuit into two spatially isolated, non-interacting patches of
qubits. We then compute the total delity as the product
of the patch delities, each of which can be easily calcu-
lated. In \elided circuits", we remove only a fraction of
the initial two-qubit gates along the slice, allowing for
entanglement between patches, which more closely mim-
ics the full experiment while still maintaining simulation
feasibility. Finally, we can also run full \verication cir-
cuits" with the same gate counts as our supremacy cir-
cuits, but with a dierent pattern for the sequence of two-
qubit gates which is much easier to simulate classically
[29]. Comparison between these variations allows track-
ing of the system delity as we approach the supremacy
regime.
We rst check that the patch and elided versions of the
verication circuits produce the same delity as the full
verication circuits up to 53 qubits, as shown in Fig.4a.
For each data point, we typically collect N
s = 5 106
total samples over ten circuit instances, where instances
dier only in the choices of single-qubit gates in each
cycle. We also show predicted F
XEB values computed
by multiplying the no-error probabilities of single- and
two-qubit gates and measurement [29]. Patch, elided,
and predicted delities all show good agreement with
the delities of the corresponding full circuits, despite
the vast dierences in computational complexity and en-
tanglement. This gives us condence that elided circuits
can be used to accurately estimate the delity of more
complex circuits.
We proceed now to benchmark our most computa-
tionally dicult circuits. In Fig.4b, we show the mea-
sured F
XEB for 53-qubit patch and elided versions of the
full supremacy circuits with increasing depth. For the
largest circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles, we collected
N
s = 30 106 samples over 10 circuit instances, obtaining
F
XEB = (2:24 0:21) 10 3 for the elided circuits. With
5Ë™condence, we assert that the average delity of run-
ning these circuits on the quantum processor is greater
than at least 0.1%. The full data for Fig.4b should have
similar delities, but are only archived since the simula-
tion times (red numbers) take too long. It is thus in the
quantum supremacy regime.

XEB values for patch, elided,

simulation. Here, the two-qubit gates are applied in a simpliable tiling and sequence such that the full circuits can be simulated
out to n= 53;m= 14 in a reasonable amount of time. Each data point is an average over 10 distinct quantum circuit instances
that dier in their single-qubit gates (for n= 39;42;43 only 2 instances were simulated). For each n, each instance is sampled
with N
s between 0:5M and 2:5M. The black line shows predicted F
XEB based on single- and two-qubit gate and measurement

circuits to estimate delity in the supremacy regime. b, Estimating F

two-qubit gates are applied in a non-simpliable tiling and sequence for which it is much harder to simulate. For the largest

s = 30M), we nd an average F
XEB >0.1% with 5Ë™condence, where Ë™includes both
systematic and statistical uncertainties. The corresponding full circuit data, not simulated but archived, is expected to show
similarly signicant delity. For m= 20, obtaining 1M samples on the quantum processor takes 200 seconds, while an equal
delity classical sampling would take 10,000 years on 1M cores, and verifying the delity would take millions of years.
DETERMINING THE CLASSICAL
COMPUTATIONAL COST
We simulate the quantum circuits used in the exper-
iment on classical computers for two purposes: verify-
ing our quantum processor and benchmarking methods
by computing F
XEB where possible using simpliable
circuits (Fig.4a), and estimating F
XEB as well as the
classical cost of sampling our hardest circuits (Fig.4b).
Up to 43 qubits, we use a Schrodinger algorithm (SA)
which simulates the evolution of the full quantum state;
the Julich supercomputer(100k cores, 250TB) runs the
largest cases. Above this size, there is not enough RAM
to store the quantum state [42]. For larger qubit num-
bers, we use a hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman algorithm
(SFA)[43] running on Google data centers to compute
the amplitudes of individual bitstrings. This algorithm
breaks the circuit up into two patches of qubits and e-
ciently simulates each patch using a Schrodinger method,
before connecting them using an approach reminiscent of
the Feynman path-integral. While it is more memory-
ecient, SFA becomes exponentially more computation-
ally expensive with increasing circuit depth due to the
exponential growth of paths with the number of gates
connecting the patches.
To estimate the classical computational cost of the
supremacy circuits (gray numbers, Fig.4b), we ran por-
tions of the quantum circuit simulation on both the Sum-
mit supercomputer as well as on Google clusters and ex-
trapolated to the full cost. In this extrapolation, we
account for the computational cost scaling with F
XEB,
e.g. the 0.1% delity decreases the cost by 1000[43, 44].
On the Summit supercomputer, which is currently the
most powerful in the world, we used a method inspired
by Feynman path-integrals that is most ecient at low
depth[44{47]. At m= 20 the tensors do not reasonably
t in node memory, so we can only measure runtimes
up to m= 14, for which we estimate that sampling 3M
bitstrings with 1% delity would require 1 year.
6
On Google Cloud servers, we estimate that perform-
ing the same task for m= 20 with 0:1% delity using
the SFA algorithm would cost 50 trillion core-hours and
consume 1 petawatt hour of energy. To put this in per-
spective, it took 600 seconds to sample the circuit on
the quantum processor 3 million times, where sampling
time is limited by control hardware communications; in
fact, the net quantum processor time is only about 30
seconds. The bitstring samples from this largest circuit
are archived online.
One may wonder to what extent algorithmic innova-
tion can enhance classical simulations. Our assumption,
based on insights from complexity theory, is that the cost
of this algorithmic task is exponential in nas well as m.
Indeed, simulation methods have improved steadily over
the past few years[42{50]. We expect that lower simula-
tion costs than reported here will eventually be achieved,
but we also expect they will be consistently outpaced by
hardware improvements on larger quantum processors.
VERIFYING THE DIGITAL ERROR MODEL
A key assumption underlying the theory of quantum
error correction is that quantum state errors may be con-
sidered digitized and localized [38, 51]. Under such a dig-
ital model, all errors in the evolving quantum state may
be characterized by a set of localized Pauli errors (bit-
and/or phase-
ips) interspersed into the circuit. Since
continuous amplitudes are fundamental to quantum me-
chanics, it needs to be tested whether errors in a quantum
system could be treated as discrete and probabilistic. In-
deed, our experimental observations support the validity
of this model for our processor. Our system delity is
well predicted by a simple model in which the individ-
ually characterized delities of each gate are multiplied
together (Fig 4).
To be successfully described by a digitized error model,
a system should be low in correlated errors. We achieve
this in our experiment by choosing circuits that ran-
domize and decorrelate errors, by optimizing control to
minimize systematic errors and leakage, and by design-
ing gates that operate much faster than correlated noise
sources, such as 1=f
ux noise [37]. Demonstrating a pre-
dictive uncorrelated error model up to a Hilbert space of
size 253 shows that we can build a system where quantum
resources, such as entanglement, are not prohibitively
fragile.
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?
Quantum processors based on superconducting qubits
can now perform computations in a Hilbert space of di-
mension 253 Ë‡9 1015, beyond the reach of the fastest
classical supercomputers available today. To our knowl-
edge, this experiment marks the rst computation that
can only be performed on a quantum processor. Quan-
tum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum
supremacy. We expect their computational power will
continue to grow at a double exponential rate: the clas-
sical cost of simulating a quantum circuit increases expo-
nentially with computational volume, and hardware im-
provements will likely follow a quantum-processor equiv-
alent of Mooreâ€™s law [52, 53], doubling this computational
volume every few years. To sustain the double exponen-
tial growth rate and to eventually oer the computational
volume needed to run well-known quantum algorithms,
such as the Shor or Grover algorithms [19, 54], the engi-
neering of quantum error correction will have to become
a focus of attention.
The \Extended Church-Turing Thesis" formulated by
Bernstein and Vazirani [55] asserts that any \reasonable"
model of computation can be eciently simulated by a
Turing machine. Our experiment suggests that a model
of computation may now be available that violates this
assertion. We have performed random quantum circuit
sampling in polynomial time with a physically realized
quantum processor (with suciently low error rates), yet
no ecient method is known to exist for classical comput-
ing machinery. As a result of these developments, quan-
tum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a
technology that unlocks new computational capabilities.
We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable
near-term applications.
