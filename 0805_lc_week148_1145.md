### 1145. Binary Tre Coloring Game

I find a crucial point: x is given so that the 1st player doesn't necessarily play optimally. Question is 
"if 2nd player CAN win", so 2nd player plays optimally, which is why 2nd player would always choose a node 
neighboring the 1st node 1st player chooses. If 1st player also plays optimally then it's highly unlikely
that the 2nd player can win, since the only scenario that 2nd player can tie with the 1st one would be: 

"The tree is absolutely balanced, with even number nodes, the 1st player chooses the edge node on one half,
the 2nd player chooses the edge node right next to 1st chosen node";

Besides this scenario, 2nd is always going to lose because if tree is not absolutely balanced, the 1st player 
can always choose the front point node of the larger branch.
