# In statistics and data mining, affinity propagation(AP) is a clustering algorithm 
# based on the concept of "Message passing" between data points. Unlike clustering 
# algorithms such as k-means or k-medoids, AP does not require the number of clusters
# to be determined or estimated before running the algorithm.
# AP聚类算法的核心是找到 最大化:{节点K对节点i的吸引度+节点i归于节点K}, i.e. 
# max{a(i, k) + s(i, k)}

# The inventor of AP showed that it is better for certain computer vision and computational
# biology tasks, e.g. clustering of pictures of human faces and identifying regulated 
# transcripts, than k-means, even when k-means was allowed many random restarts and initialized
# using PCA. 

# Transfer entropy is a non-parametric statistic measuring the amount of directed transfer
# of information between 2 random processes. Transfer entropy from a process X to another
# process Y is the amount of uncertainty reduced in future values of Y by knowing the past
# values of X given past values of Y.
