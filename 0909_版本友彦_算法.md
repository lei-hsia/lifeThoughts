Sakamoto Tomohiko’s Algorithm- Finding the day of the week

Input : Date: 15 August 2012 [15.08.2012]

Output : 3 i.e Wednesday

Input : Date: 24 December 2456 [24.12.2456]

Output : 0 i.e Sunday

Jan 1st 1 AD is a Monday in Gregorian calendar.
Let us consider the first case in which we do not have leap years, hence total number of days in each year is 365.January has 31 days i.e 7 * 4+3 days so the day on 1st feb will always be 3 days ahead of the day on 1st January. Now february has 28 days(excluding leap years) which is exact multiple of 7 (7 * 4=28) Hence there will be no change in the month of march and it will also be 3 days ahead of the day on 1st January of that respective year.Considering this pattern, if we create an array of the leading number of days for each month then it will be given as t[ ] = {0, 3, 3, 6, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5}.

Now let us look at the real case when there are leap years. **Every 4 years, our calculation will gain one extra day. Except every 100 years when it doesn’t. Except every 400 years when it does.** How do we put in these additional days? Well, just add y/4 – y/100 + y/400. Note that all division is integer division. This adds exactly the required number of leap days. But here is a problem, the leap day is 29 Feb and not 0 January. **This means that the current year should not be counted for the leap day calculation for the first two months.也就是说, 闰年的前两个月相当于平年，y并不能真正算这一年的，y应该要减1** So, if the months were January or February, we subtracted 1 from the year. This means that during these months, the y/4 value would be that of the previous year and would not be counted

Under this circumstances, since there's an extra day at the end of February, months from March on will be 1 day less ahead of what we have in the above array, i.e. leading days should be counted down by one, i.e. t[ ] = {0, 3, 3, 6, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5} before, now it should be t[ ] = {0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4}. This will solve the "leap year Feb. 1 extra day compress leading days from March" problem.

Summary: 
1. t[] now becomes {0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4}.
2. if m corresponds to Jan/Feb (that is, month<3) we decrement y by 1.
3. the annual increment inside the modulus is now y + y/4 – y/100 + y/400 in place of y.

C++: 
```
int day_of_the_week(int y, int m, int d) 
{ 
    // array with leading number of days values 
    int t[] = { 0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4 }; 
      
    // if month is less than 3 reduce year by 1 
    if (m < 3) y -= 1; 
      
    return ((y + y / 4 - y / 100 + y / 400 + t[m - 1] + d) % 7); 
} 
```

Java:
```
// function to implement sakamoto tomohiko algorithm 
    public static int day_of_the_week(int y, int m, int d) 
    { 
        // array with leading number of days values 
        int t[] = { 0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4 }; 
          
        // if month is less than 3 reduce year by 1 
        if (m < 3)  y -= 1; 
          
        return (y + y / 4 - y / 100 + y / 400 + t[m - 1] + d) % 7; 
    } 
```
